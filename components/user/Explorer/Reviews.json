They produce their own charcuterie and cheese above the restaurant and the pizza base is made with sourdough and baked at 450 C. We ordered two pizzas: Tomato passata, BAEST 'nduja, smoked BAEST Mozzarella, spring onions, oregano. Chanterelles, BAEST Goat Cheese, parsley puree, parsley. We definitely would rank this pizza amongst the best we've had, super nice sourdough and the ingredients on top were very good as well, and a perfect temperature and texture."
